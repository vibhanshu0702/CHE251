# Alkylation in Petroleum Refining

Alkylation is a crucial process in the petroleum refining industry, particularly for producing high-octane gasoline. The process involves the reaction of light olefins, such as propylene (C3) and butylene (C4), with isobutane in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form alkylate. Alkylate is a high-quality blending component for gasoline due to its high octane number, low vapour pressure, and lack of sulphur and aromatics, making it ideal for producing cleaner-burning fuels. There are two most widely used alkylation processes-

Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) Alkylation:  In this method, hydrofluoric acid is used as a catalyst. The HF alkylation process is known for its efficiency in producing high-quality alkylate. However, HF is highly toxic and poses significant risks in case of leaks or spills, requiring stringent safety measures.

Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4) Alkylation: This process uses sulfuric acid as a catalyst. While safer than HF, sulfuric acid alkylation requires larger volumes of acid and more frequent regeneration or replacement due to its lower catalytic activity.
